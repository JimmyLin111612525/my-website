			<h1>Jimmy Lin, 20</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="bio">
			<p>My name is Jimmy Lin and I am currently a sophomore in Stony Brook University. I'm a computer science major and trying to find my way into the Software Development field. As a computer science major, I spend most of my time completing programming assignments. When I'm not coding, you will usually find me in the university recreation center working out or at one of the dining halls eating my troubles away!</p>

			<h2>What are my goals?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="goals">
			<p>Obviously I would prefer if I landed a secure job in the software development field. I've always liked to create things from scratch. Doing so made me feel as if I'm paving my own path. If I could do the same thing while making enough money to support me and my family, I'd give up the world for that. A goal of mine that has never left my mind even for a day is hitting a 600 pound deadlift. I've watched countless videos of athletes walk up to a bar, with more than six 45 pound plates on each side, pick it up and scream with a cry of glory. At some point something triggered in me that made me want to pull that weight too. I'll admit, I'm pretty weak right now, but we all start somewhere. I will include my current workout split. If you have any suggestions on what to include or remove from split, feel free to shoot me an email!</p>

			<h2>What courses have I completed?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="courses-intro">
			<p>As a computer science student at SBU, most of my courses are and will be computer science related, so I will only be listing computer science related courses that I have been enrolled in.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="course-python">
			<p>The first programming course I enrolled in was a 101 course that was taught in Python. I went into this course not knowing a thing of the world of programming. It's embarassing, but I had trouble printing out "Hello World!" and understanding the indentation of Python. But with most things, I naturally got the hang of it. Assignments were lengthy and I would find myself late at night questioning my capabilities of a programmer. When midterms came around, I spent a ton of time going over review sheets, past exams, and code that I wrote. Althought I scored well on the midterms, the final and the class itself, I was still unsure if I was on the right path. </p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="course-114">
			<p>My second programming course I enrolled in was an introduction to Java course. I held more self confidence coming into this course due to my experiences in my first course and me self-teaching java before the course started. I breezed through programming assignments, but exams in this course weren't something I was proud of. Again, this course was only an introductory course so I wasn't taught anything as deep as algorithms or stacks. Even so, exams were riddled with questions about Java syntax and method signatures, which really lowered my exam grade. I still managed to end with a decent grade, but my thoughts on me programming for a living didn't change much.</p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div id="course-esmaili">
			<p>The third programming course was taught in Java and it was all about algorithms and data structures. We went over algorithms such as the various sorting algorithms and data structures like linked lists and queues. Assignments were very fun to complete and debug. Exams tested my knowledge of Java and programming, but there weren't any trivial questions that were presented in exams in the previous course. I scored above average on both the midterm and final. Getting an A in this course boosted my confidence as a programmer. All in all, this was an interesting and fun class.</p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="course-mips">
			<p>The fourth course I enrolled in was all about MIPS and  essential concepts of computer organization and architecture. The focus of this course is on the computer organization of a computer system, including the processor architecture and the memory system. Assignments were all focused on MIPS, which were very tedious and took a while to complete. Exams were also tough even after completing all relevant practice problems. All in all, this course required alot of time and hard work dedicated. I would hate if I had to retake this course.</p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div id="course-216">
			<p>The fifth and most recent course I enrolled in was a very messy course. The professor taught about the new things that came out with Java 8, lambda expressions, JavaFX, and OCaml. I'll admit it, this course was absolutely terrible. Information was thrown into each lecture as if there was no tomorrow and it was hard to keep up. This was obvious due to the statistics of the midterm and the final. Lucky for me, I did well enough where I don't have to retake this course. </p>
